        <p>I have always felt most like myself on the trail. The vulnerability that comes with trusting my body and the dirt under my feet to get me where I’m going makes it hard to remember the posturing and deadlines of busy, everyday life. The earth and its many sounds and smells and endless varieties feels like a sentient presence, engaged in a conversation with me and my small self. I am more present as a result. I like myself a little bit more. I feel empowered and capable. I feel courageous. I don’t feel these things out of a sense of competition or comparison, but a sense of oneness, sameness, a hovering relationality. It’s simultaneously feeling big and feeling small. Escaping myself while reckoning with myself. I can recognize my solitude while in the same breath feel a strong sense of relationship and connection to others.

          <p>The outdoors can mean a lot of things for a lot of people. No one experience is the same, and often I don’t take the time to name or consciously consider these feelings. Mostly I just like the sun on my face, the smell of the leaves, the interesting fungi, the off-chance that it might rain, the reminder that I need to reapply bug spray. The little, manageable, non-cosmic things like insects, birdsongs, and the soothing smell of dirt. These are important too. So are other people’s reasons for wanting to be there – learning how to snowshoe, doing research on prairie grasses, an excuse to get away from the familiar, a need to find solace and grieve, a search for inspiration. The outdoors can also be an unpleasant reminder, to those of us who have histories, fears, experiences that contrast mine.</p>

          <p>WWhatever brings people to the trail, however different, they’re sharing the same experience – they are on that trail, and more often than not, they are making an active choice to be there. Whether it’s in search of exercise, joy, alone time, poetry, or soil samples, they are seeking some form of experience; an answer, a release, a feeling.</p>

          <p>Wouldn’t it be a beautiful world in which we could all come together in this way?</p>

          <p>It can cost money to get on the trail, it can take transportation to get to the trail, and it can take quite a bit of free time to spend on it once you’re there. Racism, sexism, ableism, and various other can cause exclusions on the trail. Such prohibitive barriers are historical, multifaceted, and go well beyond the scope of this project. In time though, finding solutions to expanding outdoor access will need to incorporate all of these factors and more.
          </p>
          <p>For now, I’ll talk about two factors which I’ve identified as strong barriers to accessing enjoyable and powerful trail experiences, and the factors which my project works to address.

          <h3>Practical</h3>
          <img src="img/teal-line.png">
          <p>The idea for Wayfind came to me this past January, when on a hike with my dad in Grand Marais, MN, on the shore of Lake Superior. It had recently snowed, and the trail was unmarked beyond the footprints of other trail-goers, and tree and brush cover disturbance. For the most part this was fine, but in a few areas it took us some time to find the trail continuity, eventually reaching a spot that took us several minutes of exploring and searching to find what we thought was the trail - it wasn’t - and then circling back and finding the actual trail. It had gotten dark by the time we were done.
          </p>

          <p>We were never in any real danger; knowing which direction we had come from, and having Lake Superior as our  reference, plus it was a relatively short and small hiking area – we could’ve muscled our way through the brush and eventually gotten to the highway. We also had some cell signal, being so close to a town. We didn’t stress. But, imagine if we couldn’t have found our way as easily? Or if we hadn’t had a signal? The probability is still pretty high that we would’ve been fine - but the anxiety and potential fear it could’ve caused? Not so easily dismissed.

          </p>

          <p>Not only might naturally occuring issues such as the approaching nighttime  or disorienting snow  cover, impede one's ability to hike safely, but so might the human-made issue of trail maintenance. At the beginning of 2022, an estimated <b>$21.8 billion</b> of repair needs existed on roads, buildings, utility systems, and other structures and facilities across the National Park System. This figure has doubled since 2018.
          </p>

          <p>Not only that, according to the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association, <b>National
              Park Service staff has shrunk by 14%</b> over the last decade, primarily due to Federal funding cuts.
            <b>Total visitation has increased by 20% during the same period.</b> TThis leads to overwhelmed staff and facilities, a record number of rescues, and a trail maintenance deficit that steadily grows. Trail maintenance staff across the country are not able to keep up with demands in the current conditions, leaving the parks, reserves, forests, and trails to suffer.
          </p>

          <blockquote>Park staff say a lack of preparedness, particularly among newcomers who may underestimate the extremes of these wild places, has driven up search and rescue costs and monopolized ranger time." <p class="quote-author">– Annette McGivney, <em>The Guardian</em></p></blockquote>

          <h3>Perceptual</h3>
          <img src="img/teal-line.png">
          <p>Now, imagine those scenarios/anecdotes above, except you’re a first time hiker with no experience. You
            don’t necessarily know what to look for – Is this a deer trail or a footpath? What does this symbol mean? I
            can’t see the lake anymore, so I don’t know what direction to go and am now all turned around. It’s getting
            dark and I am fearful of what kinds of animals live in this forest. Do bears live here? If I’m guessing at a
            possible outcome, the likelihood of me wanting to repeat an experience like this seems pretty dang low.

            People new to the outdoors, or fearful of the outdoors, need more support. Some of these fears can be solved
            with education and preparation. Some are bigger and more elusive, like the very real fear and history of
            racism in outdoor spaces and industries.

          <hr>
          <p>Based on my experiences, I wanted to come up with an approach that would allay the fears of people new to the outdoors and reduce the barriers of entry to the joys and benefits of hiking in new places and engaging nature. Could I develop a tool to reduce uncertainties and help people develop their own experience and practice that would build confidence in engaging nature.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Safety is our priority</h2>
      <img src="img/white-line.png">
      <p>Everything we do puts the safety of our hikers at the forefront. It might not be the sexiest priority, but we can say with confidence that leading with a passion for the well-being of our hikers and their trail experience is what sets us apart as trustworthy, dependable, and authentic. Safety doesn’t have to be synonymous with boring or lacking in adventure – in fact, quite the opposite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>...so that experience is yours</h2>
      <img src="img/white-line.png">
      <p>We worry about safety so that the hiker can move with confidence. Our work puts the mind at ease, inviting a calm, organic, immersive experience. By putting the hiker first, and focusing on their outdoor experience, we encourage the hiker to do the same for themselves.</p>

      <p>We are especially eager to emphasize this for first-time trail users and outdoorspeople. The trail can be a scary unknown, and by making it safer and more known, we are intentionally welcoming more people to it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Less is more</h2>
      <img src="img/white-line.png">
      <p>Slowing down can be a good thing. By keeping things simple and shedding distractions, we can enhance the trail experience for everyone. Our work shouldn’t steal attention or distract; it is what makes the inspiring and the immersive possible, through minimally invasive, unassuming support.</p>

      <p>All of the benefits of analog are present (lo-fi, simple, easy) while providing important safety features of the digital age. Our brand should reflect as an alternative to our screen-centric, chaotic lives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The trail brings us closer together</h2>
      <img src="img/white-line.png">
      <p>We are never closer to our fellow humans than when we climb a mountin, canoe across a lake, or sit around a campfire together. Emphasizing our ability to strengthen these relationships, and build community, is our secret weapon. We should take every opportunity, both in our content and our design, to remind hikers of this bond. At the end of the day, Wayfind is about facilitating and inspiring connection; it is the nexus between hikers and what they hope to find outdoors.</p>

      <p>We’re not just saying it – we mean it. We’re centering all hikers, of all abilities. We’re approachable, unpretentious, and we’re demonstrating a daily commitment to encouraging and supporting new and first-time users. We keep things easy to use, without jargon, and with a healthy dose of humility.</p>

      <p>Competition and reaching the finish line have their place, but part of our focus on the hiker means no gatekeeping of outdoor activities or communities. All are invited.</p>

        <p>Next, guided by Wayfind's brand values, I built out the visual brand and style. On one hand, it was important that Wayfind's brand clearly communicated our expertise – security, capable technologies, and trustworthiness were paramount. But, it shouldn't be cold or pretentious or exclusive. I worked to find the balance: Warm but not informal. Clear but not clinical. Excited yet calm. Serious when need be, but celebratory of the everyday joys in life. The resulting brand guide worked to find this balance.</p>

        <p><b>Above all, I wanted the Wayfind brand to be genuine, human, and clear in our care for our relationship to both current and future hikers.</b></p>

          <p>Finally, to operationalize the Wayfind brand, I then made an app/prototypes. I spent a lot of time on the brand, but i wanted to think about what it would actually look like. The entire prototype built with Figma can be viewed here.
          </p>
          <p>An important part of Wayfind is its ability to make hiker's or potential hikers feel welcome, and excited for their experience. This meant that the first things a user might see were incredibly important. I wanted it to feel vibrant, interesting, and set a precedent for how their future experience with Wayfind might be.</p>

            </section>

          <p>After the initial log-in screen, I wanted to make it clear that Wayfind wants to learn about the hiker, and what they care about. Although this is a few more clicks to get through before reaching introductory screens, I thought it was important to establish this value right away. The very first thing the user learns is that Wayfind cares about them and their unique experience - and that any and all experience or desires are welcome.

      </section>


      <p>Next comes a short introduction to Wayfind that first time users would encounter. Due to the augmented reality component of the app, I thought it valuable for hikers to brief introuction to what that might look like, as well as pique the user's interest about other app components. The language is brief, but I didn't want to bog down the introduction with anything more.
